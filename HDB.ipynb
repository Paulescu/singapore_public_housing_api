    "\n",
    "We have a new flat coming up at a location closer to where my parents are staying. This makes it easier for us to take care of them, and also for them to meet our kids in the future. Howeer, as with all Singapore flats, given that they are subsidised (haevily) by the Singapore government, we will have to sell our existing flat at Yishun once we take possession of our new flat. \n",

This file will contain the code and descriptions for the HDB project that I am doing as part of my data science portfolio."

    "A huge part of this project is inspired from a [blog](https://medium.com/dsaid-govtech/wanted-data-scientists-how-we-designed-our-first-case-interview-9fd4eaa4607c) written by the [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Division (DSAID)](https://medium.com/dsaid-govtech) which I hope to get into one day. After seeing the impact they have on the life on Singaporeans, after launching useful products like the TraceTogether Token and App, I thought what they are doing is very meaningful and creates impact in our everyday lives. I am sure the job there will be sufficiently motivating in and of itself.\n",

    "I would want to start off with using the OneMap API to geocode the lat-long coordinates just for the fun of it. Intuitively, I do not think that should affect the selling price anymore than the 'Town' feature. Including it is purely for practice on calling information from APIs.\n",
